carta-casacore for Debian

This package provides a build of a custom revision of casacore with the addition 
of the CASA image analysis library. This is required as a dependency for the 
CARTA image viewer. See the changelog for the revisions of the upstream source 
which were used. This package was built with FFTW3, HDF5 and OpenMP. The Python 
3 module is also built, although it is not required by CARTA as a dependency, 
for compatibility with other casacore packages. The Python 2 module is not 
built.
